# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected middleware behavior with dynamic routes

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and middleware.  The middleware is not correctly handling dynamic segments, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The middleware is designed to redirect requests based on the dynamic segment. However, it seems to redirect unexpectedly in some circumstances.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Access the dynamic route. You may observe the unexpected redirect.

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should correctly identify and handle the dynamic segment in the URL and redirect as appropriate.

## Actual Behavior

The middleware redirects incorrectly, not applying the correct logic for the dynamic segment.

## Solution

The solution involves adjusting the middleware to correctly handle dynamic route segments.

## Additional Context

This issue appears to be related to how Next.js 15 handles middleware with dynamic routes in the App Router.
